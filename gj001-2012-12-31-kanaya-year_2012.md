# 2012: STEP FOR ANOTHER DECADE

An annual report of Ichi Kanaya, Ph.D. and PineappleDesign.org for
Year 2012.

# PREFACE

At the end of Year 2010 I wrote an annual report for that year by
typing almost-naked HTML and uploaded to Google Site. I thought it was
Google-friendly at that time. In Year 2011 I typed using Apple Pages
and uploaded PDF version to Google Site. I thought it was
human-friendly at that time.

Since I had tried both extremes of technologies and learned something
from them, I think now I know on which way I should take, and I
decided to go back to 2010-style, but use Markdown format instead of
HTML for more simplicity.

A main reason why I go back to plain text (Markdown is almost plain
text but with few exceptions) is that I'm going to put my report on
_GitHub_ and distribute it via Git repository. Through many projects
during 2012 I've tried very many communication tools, and concluded
that GitHub was the best way to _communicate_ people at last.

There are many advantages of GitHub if you compare it to Mail (or Mail
magazine), static web site, Wiki, blog, SNS (Facebook, G+, LinkedIn,
etc.), electronic publishing (ePub, iBooks, PDF), or even good and old
Google Wave. For example, you can revise your document while keeping
revision history by using Git, and readers can _pull_ the latest
change from GitHub. (You can do the same by Mercurial or even SVN, but
you cannot ignore GitHub and thus you must stick to Git.)

In Year 2011 I wrote the following: _Year 2011 will have been
remembered for another millennium. One of my homeland, Egypt, and
other Arabic countries experienced revolution starting from Tunisia,
and Japan experienced Higashinihon (East Japan) great earthquake and
tsunami which pulled nuclear disaster._

What Year 2011 was. It was an extraordinary year. And, we did many
incredible things in that year too. On the other hand Year 2012 looks
a little bit different. So many people had to _restart_ their regular
years. Physically or psycologically, we needed to overcome something.
We'll be never as same as what we used to be before 2011. Year 2012
would be memorized for the year of _seeking_ in the future; as I had
been seeking any good way to distribute this report.

# RESEARCH ON ART, ARCHAEOLOGY, AND DESIGN SCIENCE

## Art Exhibitions

### Polyphonic Jump! at Hotel Okura Kobe

During 1st to 3rd January, Mayuko Kanazawa, Masataka Imura, and I
exhibited Polyphonic Jump! at Hotel Okura Kobe.

### Interval on Time at Phantasgomaria Exhibition


### Interval on Time at Media Art Festival Kobe Exhibition


### Takahiro Matsuo's ...

### Takuya Okumra's ...



### Pineapple II.


## Scientific Publicities

### Function + Action = Interaction

In 2011 I wrote a book named _Function + Action = Program_. The book
was totally dedicated to functional programming. As the functional
programming paradigm is not bound to any specific language, I
demonstrated the concept by more than 20 languages. I've been
continuing the follow-up article named _Function + Action =
Interaction_. This article will be out in 2013 in the form of
electronic publishing and/or GitJournal.

(Another topic on mathematics is at **Design Mathematics** section.)

Trajectory 

# TOWARD 2013

## Web and Blog

The [main web site](http://www.PineappleDesign.org) has got a simple
view (again). It had been hosted on Blogger but now on a regular web
server. The old main web site now has a new name
[news.PineappleDesign.org](http://news.PineappleDesign.org) and has
been posting news ticker to the main site.

My [blog](http://blog.PineappleDesign.org) has been hosted on Tumblr
and this won't be changed. I'll experimentally unify
[Left Side Story](http://leftsidestory.pineappledesign.org),
[Affectology](http://affectology.pineappledesign.org),
[Bibliographer](http://bibliographer.pineappledesign.org) to the blog.

The Wiki sites [web](http://web.pineappledesign.org) and
[quaternion](http://quaternion.pineappledesign.org) hosted by Google
Sites can be integrated and hosted by WordPress, but this will be done
in the first quater if this will happen.

Photos are put on Flickr, viedos are put on Vimeo, sounds are put on
SoundCloud.

We'll continue to host [ARCH.SURV.](http://archsurv.tumblr.com) and
[CoreVideo.net](http://www.corevideo.net).

## Code Hosting

I'm under the process of merging all source codes I posted to
SourceForge.net, SourceForge.jp, BitBucket, etc. to
[GitHub](http://github.com/kanaya).

## SNS

I'll continue Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn. I'll also
auto-update kindle.amazon.com to open my reading status. (I'll
gradually close my Facebook account.)

I'll also update ResearchGate and ResearchMap.jp for hosting my
research works.

I'll close the following: [Skitch](http://skitch.com/kanaya) (all
images will be posted to Flickr and the blog, and Skitch is now a part
of Everonte), YouTube (all videos will be posted to Vimeo), LiveStream
(they changed pricing), FourSquare (there's no reason to check-in
anyway).

I will also close
[Backslashdot](http://backslashdot.pineappledesign.org) and
[GeekPort](http://geekport.pineappledesign.org) for focusing my
resources more to core blogs.
