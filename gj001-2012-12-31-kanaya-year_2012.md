# 2012: A STEP FOR ANOTHER DECADE

An annual report of Ichi Kanaya, Ph.D. and PineappleDesign.org for
Year 2012.

# PREFACE

At the end of Year 2010 I wrote an annual report for that year by
typing almost-naked HTML and uploaded to Google Site. I thought it was
Google-friendly at that time. In Year 2011 I typed using Apple Pages
and uploaded PDF version to Google Site. I thought it was
human-friendly at that time.

Since I had tried both extremes of technologies and learned something
from them, I think now I know on which way I should take, and I
decided to go back to 2010-style, but use Markdown format instead of
HTML for more simplicity.

A main reason why I go back to plain text (Markdown is almost plain
text but with few exceptions) is that I'm going to put my report on
_GitHub_ and distribute it via Git repository. Through many projects
during 2012 I've tried very many communication tools, and concluded
that GitHub was the best way to _communicate_ people at last.

There are many advantages of GitHub if you compare it to Mail (or Mail
magazine), static web site, Wiki, blog, SNS (Facebook, G+, LinkedIn,
etc.), electronic publishing (ePub, AMZN, iBooks, PDF), or even good
and old Google Wave. For example, you can revise your document while
keeping revision history by using Git, and readers can _pull_ the
latest change from GitHub. (You can do the same by Mercurial or even
SVN, but you cannot ignore GitHub and thus you must stick to Git.)

In Year 2011 I wrote the following: _Year 2011 will have been
remembered for another millennium. One of my homeland, Egypt, and
other Arabic countries experienced revolution starting from Tunisia,
and Japan experienced Higashinihon (East Japan) great earthquake and
tsunami which pulled nuclear disaster._

What Year 2011 was. It was an extraordinary year. And, we did many
incredible things in that year too. On the other hand Year 2012 looks
a little bit different. So many people had to _restart_ their regular
years. Physically or psycologically, we needed to overcome something.
We'll be never as same as what we used to be before 2011. Year 2012
would be memorized for the year of _seeking_ in the future; as I had
been seeking any good way to distribute this report.

# RESEARCH ON ART, ARCHAEOLOGY, AND DESIGN SCIENCE

## Art Exhibitions


### Polyphonic Jump! at Hotel Okura Kobe

Year 2012 kicked off by demonstrating _Polyphonic Jump!_, which was an
award winning interactive art created with Mayuko Kanazawa and
Masataka Imura. During 1st to 3rd January, we exhibited the
interactive art at Hotel Okura Kobe.

### Interval on Time at Phantasgomaria Exhibition



### Interval on Time at Media Art Festival Kobe Exhibition


### Takahiro Matsuo's ...

### Takuya Okumra's ...



### Pineapple II.


## Scientific Publicities

### Function + Action = Interaction

In 2011 I wrote a book named _Function + Action = Program_. The book
was totally dedicated to functional programming. As the functional
programming paradigm is not bound to any specific language, I
demonstrated the concept by more than 20 languages. I've been
continuing the follow-up article named _Function + Action =
Interaction_. This article will be out in 2013 in the form of
electronic publishing and/or GitJournal.

(Another topic on mathematics is at **Design Mathematics** section.)

## A New Book

I'm preparing a new article which potentially will be a chapter of a
new collaborative book. If it won't be published as planned, I'll
rewrite the article and publish electronically anyway.

A proposal of the chapter goes as follows:

_Interactive Art and Jocho_

_Interactive art is a form of art that involves the spectator in a way
that allows the art to achieve its purpose. Some interactive art
installations achieve this by letting the observer or visitor "walk"
in, on, and around them; some others ask the artist to become part of
the artwork. Works of this kind of art frequently feature computers
and sensors to respond to motion, heat, meteorological changes or
other types of input their makers programmed them to respond to.
[Wikipedia]_

_In this chapter I will introduce interactive art, which is considered
one of state-of-art computing technologies. This chapter will cover
relationship between art and technology, psychology and computer
science, and creativity and mathematics in terms of building of
interactive art. This chapter will conclude these aspects from a new
concept named Jocho, which will give readers a universal view of
design and engineering of the interactive art._

_For giving readers a clear view from abstract level to concrete level
while covering various angles of the interactive art, the chapter will
be divided in the following three sections._

_The first section will give readers an overview of interactive art
including their history, philosophical background, and contrast and
similarity to traditional arts and computer entertainment like video
games. This section will also pick up a concept of Jocho and how it
has been involved in interactive art. (Jocho is a Japanese word
basically meaning good atmosphere. A reason why I put this word here
is that some, and perhaps most, interactive arts don’t seem to be
understood by traditional concept of fine arts, i.e. aesthetics. Fine
arts, especially in Western world and China, are dedicated to eternal
beauty, however, such interactive arts I’m going to pick up in this
chapter are better understood by concept of Zen, instead of
eternality, as their core concept. Zen originally had a meaning of
there-is-no-eternal-things but now it is used as a paraphrase of
simplicity in many communities. Thus I choose the word Jocho which
conceptually means love to short-term but continuous beautifulness.)_

_The second section of the chapter will pick up psychological aspects
of human behavior and how to treat such aspects by computer
technology. A psychologist C. G. Jung divided activity of our hearts
in four different categories: thinking, feeling, emotion,
inspiration. This section will focus how artists have been
implementing the latter three (feeling, emotion, inspiration)
functions on computer systems, which are generally not fond of such
three functions. These three functions of our heart are considered
non-logical and sometimes referred as Jocho-teki (illogical) in
Japanese, however, many conventional researches including Kansei
engineering have been suggesting there are logical or logic-like
mechanism behind such complex features of human’s heart._

_Finally I will unveil a concrete mathematical framework behind
virtually all of interactive arts. This rigid framework was first
found by Alonzo Church, a grandfather of programming language LISP,
and brushed up by many computer scientists. This section will finally
lead readers to accept that the core part of the interactive arts is a
lambda calculus, which is a part of discrete mathematics developed in
20th century. At the very last the chapter will quote from a great
mathematician Kiyoshi Oka: he thought mathematics itself is based on
Jocho, since it cannot demonstrate its own consistency (Godel’s second
incompleteness theorem). The chapter will close by comparing human’s
enthusiasms for interactive arts and mathematics._

Trajectory 

# TOWARD 2013

## Web and Blog

The [main web site](http://www.PineappleDesign.org) has got a simple
view (again). It had been hosted on Blogger but now on a regular web
server. The old main web site now has a new name
[news.PineappleDesign.org](http://news.PineappleDesign.org) and has
been posting news ticker to the main site.

My [blog](http://blog.PineappleDesign.org) has been hosted on Tumblr
and this won't be changed. I'll experimentally unify
[Left Side Story](http://leftsidestory.pineappledesign.org),
[Affectology](http://affectology.pineappledesign.org),
[Bibliographer](http://bibliographer.pineappledesign.org) to the blog.

The Wiki sites [web](http://web.pineappledesign.org) and
[quaternion](http://quaternion.pineappledesign.org) hosted by Google
Sites can be integrated and hosted by WordPress, but this will be done
in the first quater if this will happen.

Photos are put on Flickr, viedos are put on Vimeo, sounds are put on
SoundCloud.

We'll continue to host [ARCH.SURV.](http://archsurv.tumblr.com) and
[CoreVideo.net](http://www.corevideo.net).

## Code Hosting

I'm under the process of merging all source codes I posted to
SourceForge.net, SourceForge.jp, BitBucket, etc. to
[GitHub](http://github.com/kanaya).

## SNS

I'll continue Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn. I'll also
auto-update kindle.amazon.com to open my reading status. (I'll
gradually close my Facebook account.)

I'll also update ResearchGate and ResearchMap.jp for hosting my
research works.

I'll close the following: [Skitch](http://skitch.com/kanaya) (all
images will be posted to Flickr and the blog, and Skitch is now a part
of Everonte), YouTube (all videos will be posted to Vimeo), LiveStream
(they changed pricing), FourSquare (there's no reason to check-in
anyway).

I will also close
[Backslashdot](http://backslashdot.pineappledesign.org) and
[GeekPort](http://geekport.pineappledesign.org) for focusing my
resources more to core blogs.
