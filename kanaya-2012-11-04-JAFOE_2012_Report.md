From 29 October 2012 to 31 Octoreb 2012, Japan-America Frontier of Engineering (JAFOE) Symposium was held at Beckman Center, Irvine, California, USA. The sypmosium was produced by National Academy of Engineering (NAE), USA, and Engineering Academy of Japan (EAJ), and supported by the Grainger Foundation, the US National Science Foundation (NSF), and Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).

## What is JAFOE?
Let me quote description of JAFOE from web site of National Academy of Engineering.

> The 2012 Japan-American Frontiers of Engineering will be held October 29-31, 2012, at the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center in Irvine, California.  Sixty of the most promising engineers under the age of 45 from Japan and the United States will meet for an intensive 2-1/2 day symposium on developments at the cutting edge of engineering technology. The event is intended to facilitate international and cross-disciplinary research collaboration, promote the transfer of new techniques and approaches across disparate engineering fields, and encourage the creation of a transpacific network of world-class engineers.

To add to this, the symposium was closed event that each only 30 engineers could join.

Each JAFOE symposium has 4 sessions. The year 2012 has the following sessions: Video content analysis, engineering for natural desaster resiliency, engineering for agriculture, and sports engineering.

As we had had ten JAFOE symposia so far, the 11th JAFOE in 2012 hosted new topics based on "Engineering for X" paradigm, but not traditional X-Engineering like material engineering, bio enigneering, etc. The original topics for 2012 were engineering for security, engineering for natural disaster, engineering for agricluture, and engineering for sports; and we tweaked some of them a little bit. For example, to broaden area of interesting, we changed the title of engineering for security to video content analysis.

## From my Day One diary

### Day 0

On 28 October 2012, I had a trip from Japan to US. At first I had to take a flight from ITM to NRT by ANA. As it was not a connection flight to US, I could smoothly checked in on 2F of ITM airport. I checked in around 7:10 or so. ANA lounge was renewed and comfortable as it usually was.

On the flight from ITM to NRT I fell in sleep and the travel seemed light speed to me. I shared the same flight with Prof. Kurata.

At NRT airport I met Prof. Nakamura, who also travelled from ITM but by JAL. I checked-in to Delta and soon I had a breakfast there.

I needed to talk with Prof. Nagasaka before our arrival at US so I waited for him. Finally we met each other at the gate of boarding and discussed how to operate agriculture session. We asked Prof. Tada and Prof. Suzuki to have talks on stage.

The flight from NRT to LAX was also smooth. I couldn't stop watching Harry Potter and Deathly Hollows part 1 but I slept almost all the time, thus I was refreshed when the airplane arrived at LAX on 9:00.

Dr. Kuno, Ms. Tanaka and I checked everyone was there and took a reserved bus to the hotel.

Hyatt Newport Beach was the place I once visited to in 2009. There was the 9th JAFOE there. We lined up in front of the check-in counter and disappointed that the rooms were not ready.

Some of us, including me, walked to Fashion Island and had a lunch after breaking in several groups. We bought tons of beers at Whole Foods and took a couple of taxi back to the hotel.

National Academy of Engineering held a reception at this evening. I talked with Janet of NAE and knew a hurricane Sandy was so big that was closing almost every airport in northern east coast.

Finally we could meet Katharine, a co-chair of the event, and talked many topics for the event.

We moved to my room (Lido 243) and had a party. Most participants are Japanese but there was a guy from US too. We spent lots of fun until 2:00.

### Day 1

At 7:20 I woke up and knew I was too late to wake up… but I could catch a bus starting at 7:45. The bus starts at 7:00, 7:15, 7:30, and 7:45.

At Beckman centre I had a short breakfast and went to the hall to meet Katharine. We had a short conversation and shared how to open the event.

At 8:30, the 11th JAFOE opened. Dr. Venkatesh Narayanamurti of NAE made a welcome remark, and Dr. Mineya Kuno gave a short but interesting speech. He justified existence of JAFOE in engineering manner.

I briefly introduced how we chosen 4 topics for 2012, and handed podium to Katharine. She concluded the opening by encouraging participants to share their ideas.

Soon after that Video Content Analysis session started. Andy (Cornell Univ) and Yoshikazu (Univ Tokyo) briefly illustrated the session objectives and introduced each speakers.

Both Rogerio (IBM) and Alex (Stony Brooks Univ) introduced relatively closer topics. They demonstrated video survey technology in a different way.

Yoshinobu (Fujitsu) showed his research on extracting texts from superimposed titles of video, and Kiyoshi (Osaka Univ) introduced Augmented Reality technology. At Q&A time, Kiyoshi had to explain technologies of head mounted displays and had a short lecture on them.

After the Video Content Analysis session we had a lunch break. It was a great day to have a lunch outside.

We had a poster session after the break. Katharine and I were also poster presenters.

After the poster session, we had the first part of Engineering for Natural Disaster Resiliency session. Sissy (Mueser Rutledge) showed an outlook of the session. Yuko (Swiss Re) talked about risk evaluation and Nadia (CalTech) talked about Earthquake modelling. The risk management was somewhat new topic in JAFOE, I thought, and was something we should have had.

Dinner was served at Beckman centre and the dinner speech was given by Dr. Maxine Savitz. At dinner time I was on the same table with Venkatesh. He was full of energy and interesting man. He said: **science is an applied engineering.** He also said: remember Maxwell, what he was? He was an electric engineer and he wanted to know what was behind what he was using. Everyone on the table all nodded to his talk.

I found my fridge at the hotel was completely empty. All beer and whisky were disappeared at the very first day of the stay. Yoshisada visited my room but I had to confess that there was no beer left.

### Day 2

Since we had no beer at last night I was a little bit easier to start the morning. I picked up a bus at 7:15 and had a breakfast at Beckman centre.

I briefly opened the day 2 and introduced Akihiro. He gave an introduction of the part 2 of the Natural Disaster Resiliency session.

Masahiro (Kyoto Univ) showed a unique research about “triage” of building for post-earthquake.

Daniel (ExxonMobile) was a designer and showed some of extra-huge structures for mining oil under the sea. Photos of his slides were awesome.

Topics of all four speakers of this session covers various fields and quite interesting to me.

After a 30-min break we entered to the third session named Engineering for Agriculture. Yoshisada (National Agriculture Research) and Luis (Univ Illinois) figured out outline of the session. This was what Katharine and I already knew though, the area of the session covered was so broad. Yoshisada and Luis did heroic job, they picked up topics from production and consuming.

Amy (Iowa State Univ) showed a precision agriculture. As she showed precise image of her research by poster, her topic was easy to follow and gave bright idea to us.

Unfortunately Keigo (Univ Tokyo) could not come to JAFOE for unavoidable reason and had to cancel his talk. Chika (Tohoku Univ) and Yaeko (National Agriculture Research) beautifully covered this session. These two women's talks were really amazing even if we didn't count that they were asked to have talks at NRT airport.

After the lunch break, the agriculture session went on. Murat (Univ Arizona) showed CAE system for sustainable future, and Yoko (Ajinomoto) showed food safety and quality assurance of food products.

We had a short trip to Newport Beach Vineyards and Winery. We enjoyed beautiful wines and cheeses there. We moved to the hotel by bus and had a short but enough time to buy extra beers at Whole Foods.

We had a dinner at Hyatt Newport Beach, and gather in my room after the dinner. The party went on until 1:30.

### Day 3

The last session titled Sports Engineering was opened by Patrick (Univ Massachusetts) and Yasuo (Doshisha Univ). This session was also very unique one.

First, Kenta (Asics) introduced Asics' functional footwear design. As he was also a triathlete, his talk was so persuasive. He showed several important designs of sport shoes. Second, Matt (Jarden Team Sports) introduced sport gears (helmet, hockey stick, etc.) in terms of material engineering.

After a 30-min break, Alison Lynn (Nike) showed dynamics and biomechanics of sports. He demonstrated computer-simulation of human's movement.

And it was happened… during the last speaker, Ken (AIST), was talking about biomechanical analysis of motion of professional baseball pitchers, a fire alert rang so loudly and we had to move out the building. The fire department found it was nothing finally, but we lost precise time for the session because our bus to John Wayne (SNA) airport had to leave on 12:10. Actually some of US participants left the venue after the fire alert.

Kei came back and the session continued, but we had to omit Q&A time. I quickly gave a closing remarks and Lance (NAE) gave a final note to the participants.

All Japanese participants and some US participants had a lunch at Beckman centre and took a bus to the hotel at 12:45.

Some participants went to beach for seeing sunset, and one of them went to another direction for seeing newly built dam. Rest went to shopping at Fashion Island and brought extra beers to my room.

The nightly session went on until 2:00.
