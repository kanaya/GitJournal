# 2012: A STEP FOR ANOTHER DECADE

An annual report of Ichi Kanaya, Ph.D. and PineappleDesign.org
(Pineapple.cc) for Year 2012.

# PREFACE

In Year 2011 I wrote the following: _Year 2011 will have been
remembered for another millennium. One of my homeland, Egypt, and
other Arabic countries experienced revolution starting from Tunisia,
and Japan experienced Higashinihon (East Japan) great earthquake and
tsunami which pulled nuclear disaster._

What Year 2011 was. It was an extraordinary year. And, we did many
incredible things in that year too. On the other hand Year 2012 looks
a little bit different. So many people had to _restart_ their regular
years. Physically or psychologically, we needed to overcome something.
We'll be never as same as what we used to be before 2011. Year 2012
would be memorised for the year of _seeking_ in the future; as I had
been seeking any good way for distributing this report.

At the end of Year 2010 I wrote an annual report for that year by
typing almost-naked HTML and uploaded to Google Sites. I thought it
was Google-friendly at that time. In Year 2011 I typed using Apple
Pages and uploaded PDF version to Google Site. I thought it was
human-friendly at that time.

Since I had tried both extremes of technologies and learned something
from them, I think now I know on which way I should take, and I
decided to go back to 2010-style, but use Markdown format instead of
HTML for more simplicity.

A main reason why I go back to plain text (Markdown is almost plain
text but with few exceptions) is that I'm going to put my report on
_GitHub_ and distribute it via Git repository. Through many projects
during 2012 I've tried very many communication tools, and concluded
that GitHub was the best way to _communicate_ people at last.

There are many advantages of GitHub if you compare it to Mail (or Mail
magazine), static web site, Wiki, blog, SNS (Facebook, G+, LinkedIn,
etc.), electronic publishing (ePub, AMZN, iBooks, PDF), or even good
and old Google Wave. For example, you can revise your document while
keeping revision history by using Git, and readers can _pull_ the
latest change from GitHub. (You can do the same by Mercurial or even
SVN, but you cannot ignore GitHub and thus you must stick to Git.)

# 1. ART

Our Year 2012 opened by an art exhibition at Hotel Okura Kobe. We
spent three full days from 1 to 3 Jan. 2012 and extra few days for
setting up and shutting down.

A big news in 2012 is that Mayuko Kanazawa won the Kawaii prize for
her interactive art named Nest.

With Mayuko Kanazawa I exhibited another work at Yokohama Civic Art
Gallery and Media Art Festival Kobe exhibition.

Another big news is that Takuya Okumura, one of my students at Kyoto
Saga University of Arts, won a prize of Mitsubishi Chemical Junior
Design Award.

## 1.1 Polyphonic Jump! at Hotel Okura Kobe

Year 2012 was kicked off by demonstrating _Polyphonic Jump!_, which
was an award winning interactive art created with Mayuko Kanazawa and
Masataka Imura. During 1st to 3rd January, we exhibited the
interactive art at Hotel Okura Kobe.

We developed a special software that can screen-capture a participant
and animals and print out with a yearly calendar. Each copy was sold
at 300 yens or so. This made a little money for us.

_Polyphonic Jump!_ is an interactive media first introduced and prized
by Kobe Biennale 2011. _Polyphonic Jump!_ has a 10[m] wide canvas
covered with hand-drawn background on which hand-drawn animations of
animals are projected. Figure of audiences are captured by video
camera (Kinect) and also projected on the canvas. When the audiences
jump in front of the canvas, the animals immediately respond to the
audiences’ action.

Motions of the audiences are monitored by a Microsoft’s Kinect
sensor. A surface equation of the floor is first determined from
sensor’s output. A special algorithm to detect human’s jump by
comparing the floor model and human’s figure is developed and used.

Multiprojector is used to cover such wide (10 [m]) canvas from short
distance (2.4[m]). Geometry correction based on homograph was applied
to projection subsystem.

The back-end of the animation engine is built upon Scheme
interpreter. Scheme is a variation of LISP and has super flexibility
compared to conventional procedural/object- oriented languages like
C++ or Python. Since media art is something to shoot a moving target,
the hacker needs a maximum flexibility of writing programs. The team
of _Polyphonic Jump!_ showed Scheme was the right language to live
with.

## 1.2  Interval on Time at Phantasgomaria Exhibition

Yokohama Civic Art Gallery had Phantasgomaria Exhibition in October.
THe exhibition hosted Shimura Brothers and Mayuko Kanazawwa. Mayuko
Kanazawa and I demonstrated a new art work named _Interval on
Time_. This work was about 3[m] cylindrical shape and occupied about
10[m] x 10[m] room.

Audiences entered the cylindrical room and see six round-shaped
windows. The entire wall was covered by twigs and the audiences would
feel like they were in a nest. Through the windows audiences could see
forest around the nest, watch animals jumping and flying.

When the audiences approached to the windows, new animals would come
and see you through the window back.

This work had 6 Infrared range sensor (GP2Y0A21YK) and quad XGA
(1280x800) screens that could interact with audiences.

This work was equipped with Mac Pro of 12-core Xeon and dual HD5770,
and modified version of _Pineapple II_. Internally it used QuickTime
movie layer (5120x800) and many (over 1,000) image layers on Apple's
_Core Animation_ framework.

Six IR sensors were connected to plastic-packaged _Pineapple II_
equipped with six mini-DIN 4-pin connectors.

## 1.3 Interval on Time at Media Art Festival Kobe Exhibition

Interval on Time was shipped from Yokohama to Kobe and exhibited from
17 to 25 Nov. 2012. The IR sensors and the modified _Pineapple II_
were fine tuned so that audience could notice more interactivity than
Yokohama version.

The system had continuously worked for two months without trouble.

## 1.4 Takahiro Matsuo (Monoscape)

A prototype of _Pineapple II_ and previously-designed _Pineapple I_
were used at Takahiro Matsuo's exhibition in Artium, Fukuoka. A new
version of Kohlin, for which I supported, was also demonstrated at the
exhibition.

At the exhibition Takahiro Matsuo unveiled his new work which hosted a
giant water tank and made micro bubbles in it. A top-mounted projector
projected a beautiful abstract image onto the micro bubbles, which
looked like smoke in the water.

Four IR sensors connected to fully-packaged _Pineapple II_ was used
for sensing audience's coming and activating the micro bubble
generator.

A modified version of _Pineapple I_ was used for controlling multiple
fans to make a random wind to make Kohlin swinging. An off-the-shelf
MIDI-relay was coupled to _Pineapple I_.

## 1.5 Takuya Okumra

A prototype of _Pineapple II_ was used in Takuya Okumura's art work
(code name: smoke on the water), which finally received Mitsubishi
Chemical Junior Design Award of 2012.

Four IR sensors connected to bear-bone _Pineapple II_ was used.

## 1.6 Pineapple II

Four prototypes of _Pineapple II_ were used by various interactive
artists and computer scientists (No.1 Goshiro Yamamoto, No.2 Takuya
Okumura, No.3 Takahiro Matsuo, No.4 Mayuko Kanazawa). The fifth
_Pineapple II_ is used by me for further development.

# 2. RESEARCH

Year 2012 was a year of mathematical research to me. The first thing I
should notice is that I finally reached to Moggi's theory on Monad at
the end of my quest to expanding lambda calculus to interactive
systems. This should be discussed in **Section 2.1**.

## 2.1 Function + Action = Interaction

In 2011 I wrote a book named _Function + Action = Program_. The book
was totally dedicated to functional programming. As the functional
programming paradigm is not bound to any specific language, I
demonstrated the concept by more than 20 languages. I've been
continuing the follow-up article named _Function + Action =
Interaction_. This article will be out in 2013 in the form of
electronic publishing and/or GitJournal.

I was not satisfied to the conclusion of _Function + Action =
Prgoram_, though it fully covered all programming fields. As I wrote
in the chapter of "When is the Functional Programming not
reccomended?", interactive systems were not best described in
functional programming manner. Event driven model would be the best
solution in that field.

Still I wanted to apply functional programming paradigm to such
interactive sysetm. The answer is applying Moggi's theory on Monad. At
the first glance Moggi's theory is hard to understand, but I found it
is easily translate to familiar lambda calculus.

## 2.2 Virtual Archaeology

Ichi Kanaya, Yuki Kawae, and Prof. Hiroyuki Kamei participated and
presented our research work in Giza, Saqqara, and Kharga, Egypt at the
first international conference on Virtual Archaeology. The conference
was held at State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia.

The talk was simultaneously interpretted to Russian, and the
proceeding was published in English/Russian.

The proceedings will be published from Springer.

## 2.3 VSMM

Yoshi Yasumuro participated and presented our research work of volume
computation of Monument of Khentkawes, Giza, Egypt, at VSMM (Virtual
Systems and Multimedia) conference. The conference was held in Italy.

The proceeidngs online at IEEE Xplore.

## 2.4 Facial Design of Robots

The following article 'Facial Design of Robots' was out.

_In this research, the authors succeeded in creating facial
expressions made with the minimum necessary elements for recognising a
face. The elements are two eyes and a mouth made using precise
circles, which are transformed to make facial expressions
geometrically, through rotation and vertically scaling
transformation. The facial expression patterns made by the geometric
elements and transformations were composed employing three dimensions
of visual information that had been suggested by many previous
researches, slantedness of the mouth, openness of the face, and
slantedness of the eyes. In addition, the relationships between the
affective meanings of the visual information also corresponded to the
results of the previous researches._

_The authors found that facial expressions can be classified into 10
emotions: happy, angry, sad, disgust, fear, surprised, angry+, fear+,
neutral (pleasant) indicating positive emotion, and neutral
(unpleasant) indicating negative emotion. These emotions were
portrayed by different geometric transformations. Furthermore, the
authors discovered the “Tetrahedral model,” which can express most
clearly the geometric relationships between facial expressions. In
this model, each side connecting the face is an axis that controlled
the rotational and vertically scaling transformations of the eyes and
mouth._

## 2.5 Digital Archaeology

We have been working hard on digital archaeology projects. The
following sites are in our interests.

* Giza.
* Kharga.
* Saqqara.

# 3. DEVELOPMENT

Five prototypes of _Pineapple II_ were used in various interactive
arts and computer sicence researches.

# 3.1 Pineapple I

_Pineapple I_ is a simple microcomputer with relays, which is
based on Arduino Uno. It was first used for _Kaori_, an art work
created by Nishino, a students of mine at Kyoto Saga University of
Arts in 2011.

Later I posted how to make it on my [blog](http://blog.pineapple.cc)
and then on my [Wiki site](http://quaternion.pineappledesign.org). I
titled these articles 'Arduino for Elderly.' The original blog entries
written in 2011 still has access in December 2012.

The original article shows how to use _Pineapple I_ an an I/O for a
Mac, and how to use it from Ruby, Processing, and ActionScript
(Flash).

The _Pineapple I_ is simply an I/O for a Mac, but it also can be used
as a stand-alone computer. This is what I did for Takahiro Matsuo's
exhibition (see **Section 1.4**). I configured it as a stand-alone
computer which sent a random (but controlled) MIDI signal to an
off-the-shelf MIDI-relay unit. The MIDI-relay unit controled 100[V]
fans for swinging Kohlin.

# 3.2 Pineapple II (2012)

_Pineapple II_ is one of the most successful design in 2012. It is a
stand-alone interface that can connected to virtually any type of
sensors and convert the sensor signals to MIDI velocity signals.

The _Pineapple II_ is an Arduino-based microcomputer with nice casing
and useful LED indicators. It also has carefully designed external
connector which includes two power lines (Vcc and GND), a reset pin,
USB Data+ and Data- lines, serial TX and RX lines, I2C (TWI) lines,
and SPI lines. The serial (2 lines), I2C (2 lines), SPI (3 lines) can
be bound to 7 bit lane and drive LCD device outside the box
(theoretically).

The _Pineapple II_ has an 8-pin mini-DIN connector which hosts Vcc,
GND, and six sensor input pins. (Later I changed from 8-pin mini-DIN to
more reliable 6-pin Hirose HR10A connector. Thus I had to reduce
number of sensors from six to four.)

All source codes and board designs will be open under Creative Commons
license in 2013. Also, how-to-make-it-yourself of _Pineapple II_ will
be open in early 2013.

At TEDxOsakaU 2013 I introduced the design of _Pineapple II_.

# 3.3 Pineapple II (Early 2013)

Inspired from the successful design of original _Pineapple II_, I
decided transition from Arduino to Mbed for further improvement of
ease of use. The new computer will be named _Pineapple II (Early
2013)_.

The new _Pineapple II_ has one MIDI connector, one EXT connector
(Power, 5V out, 3.3V out, GND, 1 USB, 1 Serial/I2C, 1 SPI), four
sensor connectors (each connector has 1 5V-out, 1 3.3V-out, 1 GND, 1
sensor-in, 1 monitor-out, and 1 sensor-detector). The signal level is
set to 3.3V. It internally reserves 1 CAN bus and 1 Ethernet bus.

# 4. EDUCATION

In this year I started new trials of education. One thing I started in
2012 is Tarachine Nippon educational course for citizens. It was first
intended to children but later it was re-designed to adult oriented.

## 4.1 Introduction to Kansei Science

At Kyoto Saga University of Arts I had a course named _Introduction to
Kansei Science_ at which students would learn from physics to
psycology.

## 4.2 Media Engineering

At Kyoto Saga University of Arts I and Prof. Shizuko Hiryu of Doshisha
University had a course named _Media Engineering_ at which students
would learn audio and video engineering.

## 4.3 Film and Animation Course

Takuya Okumura, who used to be one of my students at Kyoto Saga
University of Arts, won Mitsubishi Chemical Junior Design Award 2012
by his art work.

This art work was equiped with a water tank which generated fogs on
top of it, and abstract moving picture was back-projected through the
water. As audiences touched the fog, four IR sensors detect the
audiences motion and changed the moving picture.

This art work was intended to express audiences' undercontious
feeling.

## 4.4 A New Book

I'm preparing a new article which potentially will be a chapter of a
new collaborative book. If it won't be published as planned, I'll
rewrite the article and publish electronically anyway.

A proposal of the chapter goes as follows:

_Interactive Art and Jocho_

_Interactive art is a form of art that involves the spectator in a way
that allows the art to achieve its purpose. Some interactive art
installations achieve this by letting the observer or visitor "walk"
in, on, and around them; some others ask the artist to become part of
the artwork. Works of this kind of art frequently feature computers
and sensors to respond to motion, heat, meteorological changes or
other types of input their makers programmed them to respond to.
[Wikipedia]_

_In this chapter I will introduce interactive art, which is considered
one of state-of-art computing technologies. This chapter will cover
relationship between art and technology, psychology and computer
science, and creativity and mathematics in terms of building of
interactive art. This chapter will conclude these aspects from a new
concept named Jocho, which will give readers a universal view of
design and engineering of the interactive art._

_For giving readers a clear view from abstract level to concrete level
while covering various angles of the interactive art, the chapter will
be divided in the following three sections._

_The first section will give readers an overview of interactive art
including their history, philosophical background, and contrast and
similarity to traditional arts and computer entertainment like video
games. This section will also pick up a concept of Jocho and how it
has been involved in interactive art. (Jocho is a Japanese word
basically meaning good atmosphere. A reason why I put this word here
is that some, and perhaps most, interactive arts don’t seem to be
understood by traditional concept of fine arts, i.e. aesthetics. Fine
arts, especially in Western world and China, are dedicated to eternal
beauty, however, such interactive arts I’m going to pick up in this
chapter are better understood by concept of Zen, instead of
eternality, as their core concept. Zen originally had a meaning of
there-is-no-eternal-things but now it is used as a paraphrase of
simplicity in many communities. Thus I choose the word Jocho which
conceptually means love to short-term but continuous beautifulness.)_

_The second section of the chapter will pick up psychological aspects
of human behavior and how to treat such aspects by computer
technology. A psychologist C. G. Jung divided activity of our hearts
in four different categories: thinking, feeling, emotion,
inspiration. This section will focus how artists have been
implementing the latter three (feeling, emotion, inspiration)
functions on computer systems, which are generally not fond of such
three functions. These three functions of our heart are considered
non-logical and sometimes referred as Jocho-teki (illogical) in
Japanese, however, many conventional researches including Kansei
engineering have been suggesting there are logical or logic-like
mechanism behind such complex features of human’s heart._

_Finally I will unveil a concrete mathematical framework behind
virtually all of interactive arts. This rigid framework was first
found by Alonzo Church, a grandfather of programming language LISP,
and brushed up by many computer scientists. This section will finally
lead readers to accept that the core part of the interactive arts is a
lambda calculus, which is a part of discrete mathematics developed in
20th century. At the very last the chapter will quote from a great
mathematician Kiyoshi Oka: he thought mathematics itself is based on
Jocho, since it cannot demonstrate its own consistency (Godel’s second
incompleteness theorem). The chapter will close by comparing human’s
enthusiasms for interactive arts and mathematics._

## 4.5 Master Thesises

Two students of Master Course at Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka
University graduated in March 2012.

I based one of the thesises on purely mathematics.

## 4.6 Design Mathematics (Doctoral Thesis)

Two students of Ph.D. Course at Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka
University have been writing their doctoral thesis. One of their
topics is on design mathematics, which will open a new deciplin in
design field.

## 4.7 Tarachine

From 2012 I started a new course of Tarachine Nippon lecture
series. It was first designed to children especially in Kyoto, but
later it was re-designed to adult oriented.

At the last lecture of Tarachine I picked up ancient myths of Egypt,
Greek, and Rome, classical astronomy, and gave a light of modern
scientific view to them. Each students received a piece of meteorite
as their souvenirs.

At the same lecture I served an Egyptian food and Egyptian beer,
Greece wine.

## 4.8 KAIST

The PiD lab, of which I'm a member, invited Prof. Kim and Prof. Bae
from Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology
(KAIST). Students of Saga University of Arts joined the lecture as
well as ones of Osaka University.

The lecture was very insightful and gave a big impact to the
students. Prof. Kim introduced how design stood upon logics and
science. Prof. Bae introduced his award-winning design projects
including Nanum project.

## 4.9 Lecture at Japan Design Producer's Union

Exploring Kansei of Design by Scientific Eyes was the title of the
lecture at Japan Design Producer's Union. I showed an opening movie,
introduced our works of design language, design tools, and media arts.

## 4.10 Co-Design

At Co-Design school I presented the same lecture that I gave at Japan
Design Producer's Union but with more general tone.

# 5. SOCIAL ACTIVITIES

Year 2012 was a remarkable year for me in terms of my social
activity. The first thing I will never forget would be that I
co-hosted JAFOE 2012, which will be my last JAFOE. The second thing
would be the first TEDxKyoto.

## 5.1 TEDxKyoto

I could write many things about [TEDxKyoto](http://www.tedxkyoto.com),
but I'll gradually update this section. (This is a good point of
publishing an article by Git.)

Back in 2011, as I and Itaru was doing Technology x Art x Design
(TAD), Jay and later Junya received a license for TEDxKyoto. In
Februaly they opened a kick-off party for TEDxKyoto and
TEDxKyotoChange scheduled in April. I emailed Jay to invite me to the
party. This was my first step to TEDxKyoto --- the TAD in 2011 was the
zeroth step.

Since TEDxKyotoChange was finished in April, I have been a show
producer and a chief curator of TEDxKyoto.

### Technology x Art x Design (Vol. 2)

At TEDxKyoto 2012 I and Kiyo hosted one session out of four
sessions. The session was named Technology x Art x Design --- that's
true, it was the second volume of TAD.

### Other TEDx events

I was invited to TEDxTokyo and TEDxSendai as a volunteer member.

## 5.2 TEDxOsakaU

At TEDxOsakaU 2012 I gave a TEDx talk titled 'OpenSource Hardware'. I
presented how Steve Jobs and Steve Woz started their company,
Apple. Since their start up, Apple was between the two characters:
ease of use, joy of hack. Their Apple II is a legend nowadays.

Then I noticed what Richard Stallman dedicated his entire life:
copyleft.

I said I wanted to spread my design of super-easy-to-use
microcomputer, which was meaning conversion of two different
characters Apple used to have.

This was the reason why I developed an OpenSource hardware named
_Pineapple II_.

The design of _Pineapple II_ is completely open and reusable. Its
schematic (hardware design) and firmware (built-in software) are
distributed under OpenSource licenses.

## 5.3 JAFOE 2012

In 2012 we had the 11th Japan-America Frontier of Engineering (JAFOE)
symposium, which was hosted by National Academy of Engineering (NAE),
Engineering Academy of Japan (EAJ), and Japan Science and Technology
Agency (JST).

JAFOE hosts four sessions from various engineering field every
year. Japan and US provides 30 young (aged 30 to 45) top engineers to
the symposium.

From 2009 I have been a general chair of the symposium on behalf of
Japan's side. The 2011 symposium was a remarkable one since it was
held in the year of the great earthquake, and also it was the 10th
JAFOE.

Toward the second decade, I suggested US side that we would be happy
to host sessions under the concept of Engineering for X, but not
traditional X Engineering (X = Electric, Mechanical, Bio, ...), and
we decided to host the following four sessions.

* Engineering for security.
* Engineering for natural disaster.
* Engineering for agriculture.
* Engineering for sports.

We needed slightly modifying these topics, but basically we could have
these four topics.

The web site of National Academy of Engineering reads as follows.

_The 2012 Japan-American Frontiers of Engineering was held October
29-31, 2012, at the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Centre in Irvine,
California.  Sixty of the most promising engineers under the age of 45
from Japan and the United States met for an intensive 2-1/2 day
symposium on developments at the cutting edge of engineering
technology. The event was intended to facilitate international and
cross-disciplinary research collaboration, promote the transfer of new
techniques and approaches across disparate engineering fields, and
encourage the creation of a transpacific network of world-class
engineers._

_The National Academy of Engineering would like to express its
gratitude to the following sponsors for their support of the 2012
JAFOE Symposium: The Grainger Foundation, the U.S. National Science
Foundation, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency._

# 6. BIZ

Year 2012 was the first year of shipping of _Pineapple II_. A small
amount of _Pineapple II_ was sold. This made me a real artist ---
remember Steve Jobs used to say "Real artists ship."

## 6.1 Pineapple.bz

In 2012 I'm continuously update design of _Pineapple II_ and reached
the final version which should be called _Pineappe II (early
2013)_. During this year I've got so many feedbacks from my experience
through art exhibitions of Takahiro Matsuo, Takuya Okumura, and Mayuko
Kanazawa.

I decided to start an online store that would sell _Pineapple II_ and
support users. The shop is named _Pineapple.bz_. The store will start
selling only _Pineapple II_ and then gradually widen range of
products.

## 6.2 StepStone.cc

I'm (always) writing a textbook. I used to publish in books or in PDF
format. However, I should try new forms such as iBooks.

StepStone.cc will be a host of such electronic publishing.

# 7. TOWARD 2013

Toward 2013, I'll clean up my web sites and blogs for providing more
resources to selected sites.

## 7.1 Web and Blog

I renamed my organization from PineappleDesign to just Pineapple.  I
also changed the top and second level domain name from
PineappleDesign.org to Pineapple.cc on 30 December and 31 December.

The [main web site](http://www.pineapple.cc), which had been
www.pineappledesign.org, has a new URL www.pineapple.cc and got a
simple view (again). It used to be hosted on Blogger but now on a
regular web server. The old main web site now has a new name
[pineapple news](http://news.pineapple.cc) and has been posting news
ticker to the main site.

My [pineapple blog](http://blog.pineapple.cc), which had been
blog.pineappledesign.org, has been hosted on Tumblr and this won't be
changed, except for its new URL blog.pineapple.cc.

My second blog named [LEFT SIDE STORY](http://reblog.pineapple.cc)
also has a new URL reblog.pineapple.cc. It has been hosted by Tumblr
as the main blog has been.

I'll experimentally unify
[Affectology](http://affectology.pineappledesign.org) and
[Bibliographer](http://bibliographer.pineappledesign.org) to the main
blog, and then will close these two blogs.

The Wiki sites [web](http://web.pineappledesign.org) and
[quaternion](http://quaternion.pineappledesign.org) hosted by Google
Sites may be integrated and hosted by WordPress, but this will be done
in the first quater. A new URL will be given to the Wiki sites.

Photos are put on Flickr, viedos are put on Vimeo, sounds are put on
SoundCloud.

We'll continue to host [ARCH.SURV.](http://archsurv.tumblr.com) and
[CoreVideo.net](http://www.corevideo.net).

## 7.2 Code Hosting

I'm under the process of merging all source codes I posted to
SourceForge.net, SourceForge.jp, BitBucket, etc. to GitHub. The
current address of my GitHub account is
[http://github.com/kanaya](http://github.com/kanaya), however, I will
perhaps change the URL to something like geekport.net. (I reserved
this URL for use of GeekPort, my news site which is no longer
maintained.)

## 7.3 SNS

I'll continue [Twitter](http://twitter.com/kanaya),
[Facebook](http://facebook.com/ichiroh),
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/114924661080866426175/),
[LinkedIn](http://jp.linkedin.com/in/kanaya/). I'll also auto-update
kindle.amazon.com to open my reading status. (I'll gradually close my
Facebook account.)

I'll also update ResearchGate and ResearchMap.jp for hosting my
research works.

I'll close the following: [Skitch](http://skitch.com/kanaya) (all
images will be posted to [Flickr](http://flickr.com/kanaya) and the
blog, and Skitch is now a part of Everonte), YouTube (all videos will
be posted to [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/kanaya)), LiveStream (they
changed pricing), FourSquare (there's no reason to check-in anyway).

# CONCLUDING REMARKS

On the very last day of 2012, I changed the name of my organization
from Pineapple Design (PineappleDesign.org) to Pineapple
(Pineapple.cc). I had been looking for chance to take the domain name
pineapple.cc for years, and on that day I was happened to aquire the
name. I have been keeping pineapple.bz for my business, thus I'll use
pineapple.{cc,bz} for non-profit/profit activities respectively.

I'll be aged 40 on 6th January 2013, and this will mean I'll have 10
years to go before age 50, which had been men's life span in
Japan. I'll start runnig for the last decade.
